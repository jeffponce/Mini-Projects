# Mini-Projects

Here I'm adding 4 little mini-projects where we use HTML and CSS to design different websites and menu options. Using very little JavaScript and focusing on what we can create with just HTML and CSS. 

## Presentations

This is a very simple presentation type of website where you can display information and pictures. Once you need to switch slides, you click the button and the whole slide moves up showing the next slide or webpage.

## Knowledge Timeline

A resume type of timeline that shows you the dates and what you learned. As you scroll down the timeline the individual boxes will move from off screen to center line.
